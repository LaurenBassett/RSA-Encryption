# RSA-Encryption
Completed assignmed for CS 378: Cryptography at the University of Kentucky in Spring 2020 

The objective of this project is to implement components of the RSA cryptosystem. Specifically, the following three elements:

Key setup: This module will compute and output the keys: public and private. The keys will be output to
two separate files named public key and private key.

Encryption: This module will take the public key and a message to be encrypted as the inputs. They
will be read from the files public key and message, respectively. The module will output the ciphertext
(encrypted message) which will be stored in a file named ciphertext.

Decryption: This module will take the public key, the private key and the ciphertext to be decrypted as the
inputs. They will be read from the files public key, private key and ciphertext, respectively. The module
will output the decrypted message and store it in a file named decrypted message.
